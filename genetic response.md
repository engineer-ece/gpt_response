   - Collect genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data from treated and untreated cancer cells.
   - Integrate the datasets using OmicsIntegrator.

3. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Normalize the data and filter out irrelevant features.
   - Use feature selection to identify the most informative genes and proteins.

4. **Model Selection and Construction**:
   - Choose a machine learning model, such as a random forest or neural network.
   - Define model parameters based on experimental data.

5. **Model Training and Validation**:
   - Train the model using a portion of the integrated data.
   - Validate the model using cross-validation and independent datasets.

6. **Simulation and Prediction**:
   - Run simulations to predict cell response under different drug concentrations and treatment schedules.
   - Predict changes in gene expression and protein levels.

7. **Model Interpretation and Analysis**:
   - Analyze the model predictions to identify key pathways and genes involved in drug response.
   - Perform sensitivity analysis to determine the most critical factors.

8. **Hypothesis Generation and Testing**:
   - Generate hypotheses about potential resistance mechanisms or combination therapies.
   - Design experiments to test these hypotheses and validate the model predictions.

9. **Documentation and Sharing**:
   - Document the model, including assumptions, parameters, and validation results.
   - Share the model in the BioModels database or as an SBML file.

By following these steps and utilizing the appropriate tools, you can create predictive models that provide insights into system-level effects and guide experimental design in biology and medicine.
