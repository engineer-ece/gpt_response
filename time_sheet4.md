Maximizing study time during office hours can be challenging but achievable with strategic planning. Here are some tips and a revised schedule to make the most of your breaks and downtime at work:

### Tips for Efficient Study During Office Hours

1. **Micro-Learning:** Break down study material into small, digestible chunks that you can review in short periods.
2. **Priority Focus:** Focus on less intensive tasks that can be done during short breaks, such as reading articles or watching short videos.
3. **Utilize Breaks Wisely:** Use your lunch break and other breaks to study or review materials.
4. **Audio Learning:** Listen to podcasts or audio lectures while performing non-cognitive tasks.
5. **Organize Materials:** Keep study materials easily accessible, such as on your phone or a tablet.
