how to reduce 100 kg to 80 kg how many days required workout in 20 minutes

Reducing weight from 100 kg to 80 kg requires creating a calorie deficit, where you burn more calories than you consume. Achieving this through a combination of diet and exercise is essential. Here's a plan to help you achieve your goal, along with some general guidelines on how long it might take.

### 1. Set Realistic Expectations
- **Safe weight loss**: Aiming for a weight loss of 0.5-1 kg per week is considered safe and sustainable. This means losing 20 kg could take anywhere from 20 to 40 weeks (5 to 10 months).

### 2. Diet Plan
- **Calorie deficit**: To lose weight, you need to consume fewer calories than you burn. A deficit of 500-1000 calories per day can help you lose about 0.5-1 kg per week.
- **Balanced meals**: Focus on whole foods, such as vegetables, fruits, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats.
- **Portion control**: Be mindful of portion sizes and avoid overeating.
- **Hydration**: Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated and avoid sugary drinks.

### 3. 20-Minute Workout Plan
Even with a short 20-minute workout, you can make significant progress if you combine it with a healthy diet. Here are some effective 20-minute workouts:

#### High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)
HIIT is a great way to burn calories in a short amount of time.

**Example HIIT Workout**:
- Warm-up: 2 minutes of brisk walking or jogging in place.
- **Circuit (repeat 3 times)**:
  - 1 minute of jumping jacks
  - 1 minute of push-ups
  - 1 minute of squats
  - 1 minute of burpees
  - 1 minute of rest
- Cool down: 2 minutes of stretching

#### Cardio Workout
Cardio exercises help increase your heart rate and burn calories.

**Example Cardio Workout**:
- Warm-up: 2 minutes of brisk walking or jogging in place.
- **Main Workout**:
  - 5 minutes of running or cycling at a moderate pace
  - 5 minutes of jumping rope
  - 5 minutes of dancing or aerobic exercise
- Cool down: 3 minutes of stretching

#### Strength Training
Strength training helps build muscle, which can increase your metabolism.

**Example Strength Training Workout**:
- Warm-up: 2 minutes of light cardio (walking or jogging in place).
- **Circuit (repeat 3 times)**:
  - 1 minute of bodyweight squats
  - 1 minute of push-ups
  - 1 minute of lunges (30 seconds per leg)
  - 1 minute of plank
  - 1 minute of rest
- Cool down: 2 minutes of stretching

### 4. Additional Tips
- **Consistency**: Stick to your workout and diet plan consistently for the best results.
- **Increase intensity**: As you get fitter, increase the intensity of your workouts to continue challenging your body.
- **Monitor progress**: Track your weight, diet, and exercise to stay motivated and make necessary adjustments.
- **Rest and recovery**: Ensure you get enough sleep and allow your body to recover between workouts.

### Estimated Time Frame
If you follow a balanced diet and consistently perform 20-minute workouts daily, you can expect to lose about 0.5-1 kg per week. Therefore, losing 20 kg could take approximately 20 to 40 weeks. However, individual results may vary based on factors such as age, gender, metabolism, and starting fitness level.

### Sample Weekly Schedule
**Monday**: HIIT workout (20 minutes)
**Tuesday**: Cardio workout (20 minutes)
**Wednesday**: Strength training (20 minutes)
**Thursday**: HIIT workout (20 minutes)
**Friday**: Cardio workout (20 minutes)
**Saturday**: Strength training (20 minutes)
**Sunday**: Rest or light activity (e.g., walking)

Remember, combining these workouts with a healthy diet and lifestyle changes is key to achieving and maintaining weight loss.
